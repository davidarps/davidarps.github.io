I am a doctoral student in Computational Linguistics at HHU Düsseldorf. My advisors are [Laura Kallmeyer](https://user.phil.hhu.de/kallmeyer/) and [Hassan Sajjad](https://hsajjad.github.io/).
My research is funded by the project [Inducing Syntactic Structure](https://iss.phil.hhu.de/), which investigates approaches to induce syntactic structures from language models. 
In addition, I collaborate with the [Hypermatrix Lab](https://hypermatrix.cs.dal.ca/) at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.

I supervise BA and MA theses and student projects, with a particular interest in topics related to my research. If you are interested in pursuing a topic in this area, please get in touch.
I occasionally teach in the [Department of Computational Linguistics](https://studycl.phil.hhu.de/), and have taught in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.heicad.hhu.de/lehre/masters-programme-ai-and-data-science).
